# humpbot
bot i'm not working on anymore cuz i'm lazy f  
  
  
to make it work:
```
git clone https://github.com/k0bdev/humpbot.git
cd humpbot
npm i
```

and then modify settings.json and index.js variables from line 9 to your choice  
  
i know code is terrible, i didnt have time to rewrite it
also there are some portions of messages that are set only for my server so if you want make it actually something then modify some emoji ids etc.  

default prefix is (as far as i remember): `>`
