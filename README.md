# humpbot
bot i'm not working on anymore cuz i'm lazy f  
  
  
## To make it work:
```
git clone https://github.com/k0bdev/humpbot.git
cd humpbot
npm i
```

...and then modify settings.json and index.js variables from line 9 and last to your choice  
  
**I know code is terrible**, I didnt have time to rewrite it
...also there are some portions of messages that are set only for my server so if you want make it actually something then modify some emoji ids etc.  

Default prefix is *(as far as i remember)*: `>`  
  
### Oh and you might ask, what this bot do?
